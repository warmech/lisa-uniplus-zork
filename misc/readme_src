Welcome to Zork! Sort of...

This collection of files will allow you to compile Mainframe Zork from its C
source files for UniPlus (System V) Unix on the Apple Lisa. These files were 
derived from FORTRAN77 source code via the f2c conversion utility in the 
distant past (the F77 source itself a port of the origianl MDL code written 
on a PDP-10 at MIT in the 1970s, F77 being a much more portable language that 
allowed Zork to eventually be built on a PDP-11).

Minimal changes have been made to allow this code to be compiled successfully;
UniPlus on the Lisa is a bit more forgiving than Xenix on the Lisa; its C
compiler, for instance, can handle constants (whereas Xenix's cannot) and
terminal support is a bit easier to work with.

This set of two (2) disks contains the following files:

FILES:

	Disk 1: SOURCE FILES
	
		readme      - this file
		setup.sh    - the setup script
		zork_c.tar  - the C source files tarball
		
	Disk 2: ADDITIONAL DATA
	
		zork_d.tar  - the game database tarball
		zork_h.tar  - the C header files tarball
		zork_m.tar  - the makefile tarball

SETUP:

	Begin by copying the setup.sh file to the hard disk. This is done with:
	
	cp setup.sh /
	
	Once copied, run the setup script with:
	
	./setup.sh
	
	and follow the instructions to swap out disks when prompted.
	
	Once complete, cd into /tmp/zork and use the following commands to 
	build Zork from source:
	
	make
	make install
	
	This will built the zork binary and then install it to /usr/games and 
	then install its database file to /usr/games/lib.
